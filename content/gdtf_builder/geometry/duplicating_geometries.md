To duplicate a single geometry or a part of the geometry tree, select a geometry in the geometry tree. Then open the context menu (**â‰¡**) and choose one of the following options:

### Duplicate Selection

This option creates one copy of the selected geometry and its child geometries on the same level of the geometry tree. A number is appended to the geometry names to make sure that all geometries are named uniquely.

When duplicating a top-level geometry, the duplicate is placed at the same position as the original geometry. When duplicating a child geometry, the duplicate is placed next to the original geometry on the X axis.

### Multiple Duplication

This option creates multiple copies of the selected geometry and its child geometries on the same level of the geometry tree. A number is appended to the geometry names to make sure that all geometries are named uniquely.

When choosing this option, enter the number of copies to create in the pop-up window.

When duplicating a top-level geometry, the duplicates are placed at the same position as the original geometry. When duplicating a child geometry, the duplicates are placed next to each other on the X axis.
