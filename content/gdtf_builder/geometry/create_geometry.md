### General Properties

The name of a geometry has to be unique for the whole GDTF file.

If Use File Dimensions is enabled, the geometry receives its dimensions from the linked 3D model. If Use File Dimensions is disabled, the dimensions given in the Length, Width and Height fields are used.
Use File Dimensions is not available for the included standard models (primitive types).

### Geometry Type

DefinesÂ special functions of the geometry. Read more about the available geometry types in the GDTF Spec (section Geometry Collect).

### Select Model

To link a 3D model to the geometry, use one of the following options:

*   Upload Mesh...: Opens a file browser to choose and upload a 3D model from the hard drive.
*   New Default Base etc.: Creates a new instance of one of the available primitive types.
*   Existing model: Use this option to link a model that already exists in the GDTF file.
*   New Empty Geometry: No 3D model is linked to the geometry.

After a custom model is linked, it is possible to upload additional levels of detail for that model. This can be done in the model properties.
