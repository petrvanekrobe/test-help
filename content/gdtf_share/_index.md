The **GDTF Share** is a platform for the exchange of GDTF files.

GDTF files from various manufacturers are available here for download. GDTF
files built by other users are also available and users can upload their own
GDTF files.

There is detailed information for each GDTF file. The DMX modes, DMX footprint,
notes, and revision history can be viewed without having to download the files
first.

Each GDTF file uploaded can have comments, ratings, and different tags. This
makes it possible to identify the quality of GDTF files. 

Entire collections of GDTF files can be downloaded in one zip file.
