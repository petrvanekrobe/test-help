When a fixture is selected, a list of the revision is shown. Many fixtures only have one revision. The revision list is displayed as a row with columns offering information about each revision. Selecting a revision displays more detailed information below the revision list.

A vertical bar with the menu icon  {{% image_inline src="../../media/Icon_Menu.png" alt="" %}}  is displayed on the left side.

To close and open the [Fixture Browser](browse_files), click this icon.

## Revision Information

Information about the selected revision is displayed below the list of revisions.

If any of the **Revision Tags** are active in the file, there is further information about the tags. For instance, it lists which users have tagged the file.

There is also information about the channels and what attribute each channel controls. This information can be viewed in two versions: **Plain View** or **Smart View**. It can be toggled by clicking the gray text next to the DMX modes heading. The smart view divides the channels into the geometries of the fixture. If the fixture only has one geometry, there is no difference between the two views.

The **Revision History** is displayed below the DMX information.

The box **Comments** is displayed on the right side.

Write and submit comments here.

It is possible to view any comment from other fixture share users.

To help other users, always comment on GDTF files.
