**Search bar** is displayed below the title bar.

_Search bar_

The search is performed in the boxes checked below the input field. Each
checkbox corresponds to an area and the search finds matching text in the areas
checked. The areas selected can be changed before the search is started.
Changing the selected area cancels an active search.

The text searched for is displayed in the input field. The search is not
case-sensitive. Single words are searched in each activated area. If a group of
words is to be searched as a group, enter it in double quotation marks.

For instance, if a search is done for: **profile 700**, results are also found
with the name **700 Profile**. But if the words are in double quotation
marks: **"profile 700"**, the result only lists the fixtures where the precise
order of words is the same.

The search text can be cleared by clicking {{% image_inline src="../../media/Icon_Close.png" alt="" %}}  in the field.

To perform the search click the Search button.

The result is shown right below the search bar. It always displays
the **Manufacturer**, **Fixture**, **Modes**, and **Revision**. Clicking on one
of the results opens the Fixture and Revision Information page about the
selected file.

The search results can be closed instead of selecting one of the results by
clicking {{% image_inline src="../../media/Icon_Close.png" alt="" %}}  in the
upper right corner of the search result.
