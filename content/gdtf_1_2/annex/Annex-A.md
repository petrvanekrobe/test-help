## Annex A. (normative) Attribute Definitions

To describe the fixture types attributes are used. Attributes define the
function. (n) and (m) are wildcards for the enumeration of attributes
like Gobo(n) - Gobo1 and Gobo2 or VideoEffect(n)Parameter(m) -
VideoEffect1Parameter1 and VideoEffect1Parameter2. Fixture Type
Attributes without wildcards (n) or (m) are not enumerated. The
enumeration starts with 1. The currently defined Fixture Type Attributes
are specified in [table A1](#table-a1).

Note 1: The predefined Fixture Type Attributes are the preferred to use Fixture
Type Attribute. At any time user defined attributes can be introduced as well.
