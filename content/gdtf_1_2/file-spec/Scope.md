## Scope

This document specifies the “General Device Type Format”(GDTF), a unified way of listing and describing the 
hierarchical and logical structure and controls of any type of controllable device (e.g. luminaires, fog machines, 
etc.) in the lighting and entertainment industry. It will be used as a foundation for the exchange of device data 
between lighting consoles, CAD and 3D-pre-visualization applications. The purpose of an existing GDTF-file is 
to reflect the real-world physical components of the devices and to provide control based on this information. 
It contains and is derived from the 3D geometry (real world or virtual) of the device. 
This document is only applicable for lighting systems and equipment used in the entertainment industry.
